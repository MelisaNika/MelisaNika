### Hellou ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: FamilyTree project (it probably ends up as a silly little thing, but who cares)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: python
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: ... nobody, I just code for fun and it's nothing const
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: basic python I assume
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: ... no
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: I would probably ghost you, sorry in advance
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her but why would you use it if you're not reaching to me
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love games, and most of my statuses on dc are per "hamster doing sth"

one day, maybe I'll make a nicer profile
